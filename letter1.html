                Somewhere in Milwaukee a happy couple unpacks the last of their boxes into their first apartment together. They gaze around their new home. An amalgamation of possessions from 
                two lives lived lay spread throughout, beautifully entangled. On a shelf in the corner, a collection of polaroid pictures from their greatest moments stand triumphantly.
                They gaze into each other's eyes. This is only the beginning of some grand adventure.
                <br><br>
                Years later, the couple sit on the floor in the same apartment. Although this time it is completly empty of all belongings, the memories they made there still echo throughout.
                This was a place of firsts. They drink wine into the early hours of the morning, talking about all the little things they'll miss that made it home. They gaze into
                each other's eyes. Where to next?
                <br><br>
                At their townhouse in D.C. the couple pack their bags for what they intend to be their last big trip for the forseable future. They spent the majority of their 20s exploring
                the world and growing their love. Souviners, trinkets, and keepsakes from all 50 States, Europe, Asia, Africa, Austrailia, and South America decorate their bedroom. However, 
                even the seven wonders of the world pail in comparison to what awaits them. The man gently holds his hand on the woman's stomach. They gaze into each other's eyes. The best
                is yet to come.
                <br><br>
                In a suburb in Wisconsin, where no two houses look the same, three children run around the backyard of their family home. Their parents look out at them smiling from the padio 
                window. They can't believe how fast their growing. Yesterday they were all in diapers, and tomorrow they'll be graduating from college. 
                They gaze into each other's eyes. How did we get so lucky?
                <br><br>
                On a lake in Wisconsin, the couple's now grown children come to visit bringing kids of their own. They joyously sit around the living room together laughing. The couple, now
                old and grey, gaze into each other's eyes. It was all for this.
